    "The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. \\\n",
    "On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order)\n",
    "to form a single two-digit number.\n",

    "The gardener and his team want to get started as soon as possible, so they'd like to know the closest location that needs a seed. Using these maps, find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seeds. To do this, you'll need to convert each seed number through other categories until you can find its corresponding location number.\n",
